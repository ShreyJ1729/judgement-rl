## Key Features Implemented

### 1. PPO Algorithm Components

#### Policy Network Architecture

```python
class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, max_action_dim, hidden_dim=256):
        # Shared layers for feature extraction
        self.shared_layers = nn.Sequential(...)
        # Policy head for action probabilities
        self.policy_head = nn.Linear(hidden_dim // 2, max_action_dim)
        # Value head for state value estimation
        self.value_head = nn.Linear(hidden_dim // 2, 1)
```

#### PPO Training Loop

- **GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)** for advantage computation
- **Clipped objective** to prevent large policy updates
- **Value function learning** for better state estimation
- **Entropy regularization** for exploration
- **Gradient clipping** for training stability

### 2. Self-Play Training

#### Multi-Agent Training

- Multiple agents start with identical policies
- Agents compete against each other in games
- Best performing agent's policy is copied to others (with noise)
- Continuous improvement through competition

#### Self-Play Algorithm

```python
def train(self, num_episodes, episodes_per_update=10, epsilon=0.1, batch_size=64):
    for episode in range(num_episodes):
        # Train one episode
        episode_rewards = self.train_episode(epsilon)

        # Update policies every few episodes
        if (episode + 1) % episodes_per_update == 0:
            for agent in self.agents:
                agent.train(batch_size=batch_size)

            # Update best agent and copy policy
            self.current_best_agent = np.argmax(avg_performances)
            # Copy best agent's policy to others with noise
```

### 3. State and Action Handling

#### Legal Action Masking

- Actions are masked to only allow legal moves
- Prevents invalid bids and card plays
- Maintains proper probability distributions

#### State Encoding Integration

- Uses the state encoder from Step 3
- Handles both bidding and card playing phases
- Supports variable action spaces based on round cards

### 4. Training Features

#### Experience Collection

- Stores states, actions, rewards, and probabilities
- Supports both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios
- Handles episode termination and reward calculation

#### Training Statistics

- Tracks episode rewards, policy losses, value losses
- Monitors training progress and convergence
- Provides visualization capabilities

## Usage Examples

### Basic PPO Agent Training

```python
from agent import PPOAgent
from judgement_env import JudgementEnv
from state_encoder import StateEncoder

# Initialize components
env = JudgementEnv(num_players=4, max_cards=7)
state_encoder = StateEncoder(num_players=4, max_cards=7)
agent = PPOAgent(state_encoder)

# Train agent
for episode in range(1000):
    agent.collect_experience(env, num_episodes=1, epsilon=0.1)
    if (episode + 1) % 10 == 0:
        agent.train(batch_size=64)
```

### Self-Play Training

```python
from agent import SelfPlayTrainer

# Initialize self-play trainer
trainer = SelfPlayTrainer(env, state_encoder, num_agents=4)

# Train with self-play
trainer.train(num_episodes=500, episodes_per_update=10)

# Get best agent
best_agent = trainer.agents[trainer.current_best_agent]
```

### Model Saving and Loading

```python
# Save trained model
agent.save_model('models/trained_agent.pth')

# Load model
new_agent = PPOAgent(state_encoder)
new_agent.load_model('models/trained_agent.pth')
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Training Efficiency
