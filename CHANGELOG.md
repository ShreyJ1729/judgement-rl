## Migration Guide

### From Version 1.0.0 to 2.0.0

#### Configuration Changes

```python
# Old way (v1.0.0)
env = JudgementEnv(num_players=4, max_cards=7)

# New way (v2.0.0)
from judgement_rl.config import EnvironmentConfig, RewardConfig

env_config = EnvironmentConfig(
    num_players=4,
    max_cards=7,
    reward_config=RewardConfig()
)
env = JudgementEnv(config=env_config)
```

#### Training Changes

```python
# Old way (v1.0.0)
# Direct script execution with hardcoded parameters

# New way (v2.0.0)
from judgement_rl import SelfPlayTrainer
from judgement_rl.config import TrainingConfig

config = TrainingConfig(num_episodes=1000)
trainer = SelfPlayTrainer(training_config=config)
stats = trainer.train(num_episodes=1000)
```

#### Logging Changes

```python
# Old way (v1.0.0)
print(f"Episode {episode}: Reward = {reward}")

# New way (v2.0.0)
from judgement_rl.utils.logging import TrainingLogger

logger = TrainingLogger(log_dir="logs/", experiment_name="training")
logger.log_episode(episode=episode, reward=reward)
```

#### CLI Usage

```bash
# Old way (v1.0.0)
python train.py

# New way (v2.0.0)
python -m judgement_rl.cli.train --episodes 1000 --mode self-play
```

### Breaking Changes

1. **Configuration System**: All hardcoded parameters now require configuration objects
2. **Import Structure**: Package imports have changed to use the new modular structure
3. **Training Interface**: Training now uses the SelfPlayTrainer class instead of direct scripts
4. **Logging**: All logging now uses the structured logging system
5. **Environment Interface**: Environment creation now requires configuration objects

### Deprecation Warnings

- Old training scripts will be removed in version 3.0.0
- Direct environment parameter passing will be deprecated in version 2.1.0
- Basic print-based logging will be removed in version 2.1.0

## Future Plans

### Version 2.1.0 (Planned)

- GUI interface implementation
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Enhanced hyperparameter optimization
- Additional agent algorithms (DQN, A3C)

### Version 2.2.0 (Planned)

- Distributed training support
- Model serving capabilities
- Advanced evaluation metrics
- Plugin system for custom components

### Version 3.0.0 (Planned)

- Complete API redesign for better extensibility
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced monitoring and visualization
