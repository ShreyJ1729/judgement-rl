Introduction
"Judgement" is a trick-taking card game where players bid on the number of tricks they aim to win in each round and play cards to meet their bids. The game features unique mechanics:

Rounds: Card counts vary (e.g., 7, 6, 5, ..., 1, then 2, 3, ..., 7).
Trump Suits: Rotate through No Trump, Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts.
Bidding: Total bids must not equal the number of players.
Scoring: Players score highly for meeting bids exactly, with penalties otherwise.

The goal of this project is to create an AI that learns optimal strategies for bidding and gameplay using RL.
Prerequisites
To get started, you’ll need:

Python Knowledge: Familiarity with Python programming.
Reinforcement Learning Basics: Understanding of states, actions, and rewards.
Deep Learning Frameworks: Experience with PyTorch or TensorFlow is helpful.
Tools: Git, a Python IDE (e.g., VSCode), and a virtual environment.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Set Up the Environment
Let’s set up your development environment.

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/judgement-ai.git
cd judgement-ai

Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies:Create a requirements.txt file with:
torch
numpy

Then run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 2: Implement the Game Logic
The game logic lives in judgement_env.py. You’ll create a class to manage the game state and rules.
Key Features:

Deal cards based on the round.
Rotate trump suits.
Handle bidding and trick-taking.

Code Example:
import random

class JudgementEnv:
def **init**(self, num_players=4, max_cards=7):
self.num_players = num_players
self.max_cards = max_cards
self.trump_suits = ["No Trump", "Spades", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts"]
self.reset()

    def reset(self):
        self.round_cards = random.randint(1, self.max_cards)  # Simplify for now
        self.trump = self.trump_suits[0]  # Rotate in full implementation
        self.deck = self._create_deck()
        self.hands = self._deal_cards()
        self.declarations = [0] * self.num_players
        self.tricks_won = [0] * self.num_players
        self.current_trick = []
        return self._get_state(0)

    def _create_deck(self):
        suits = ["Spades", "Diamonds", "Clubs", "Hearts"]
        ranks = [str(i) for i in range(2, 11)] + ["J", "Q", "K", "A"]
        return [f"{rank} of {suit}" for suit in suits for rank in ranks]

    def _deal_cards(self):
        deck = self.deck.copy()
        random.shuffle(deck)
        return [deck[i::self.num_players][:self.round_cards] for i in range(self.num_players)]

    def _get_state(self, player_idx):
        state = {
            "hand": self.hands[player_idx],
            "trump": self.trump,
            "declarations": self.declarations.copy(),
            "current_trick": self.current_trick.copy(),
            "tricks_won": self.tricks_won.copy()
        }
        if self.round_cards == 1:
            state["others_cards"] = [self.hands[i][0] for i in range(self.num_players) if i != player_idx]
        return state

Tasks:

Add a step method to handle bidding and card play.
Implement trick resolution (e.g., highest trump or suit wins).

Step 3: Define the State Representation
The state tells the AI what’s happening in the game. Include:

Player’s hand.
Trump suit.
All players’ bids.
Current trick and trick history.
Visible cards in the one-card round.

Code Example:See the \_get_state method above. You’ll need to encode this into a numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding) for the RL agent later.
Step 4: Define the Action Space
The AI has two decision types:

Bidding: Choose a number from 0 to round_cards.
Playing: Select a legal card from the hand.

Code Example:
def step(self, player_idx, action):
if len(self.declarations) < self.num_players:
self.declarations[player_idx] = action
return self.\_get_state((player_idx + 1) % self.num_players), 0, False
else:
card = self.hands[player_idx].pop(action)
self.current_trick.append((player_idx, card)) # Add trick resolution logic here
return self.\_get_state((player_idx + 1) % self.num_players), 0, False

Tasks:

Enforce bidding rules (e.g., last player can’t make total bids equal number of players).
Filter legal card plays (e.g., must follow suit).

Step 5: Design the Reward System
Rewards guide the AI’s learning:

End of Round: Score based on meeting the bid (e.g., 11n + 10 if exact, -10|n - actual| otherwise).
During Play: Small rewards for winning tricks up to the bid.

Code Example:
def \_calculate_reward(self, player_idx):
n = self.declarations[player_idx]
actual = self.tricks_won[player_idx]
if n == actual:
return 11 _ n + 10
return -10 _ abs(n - actual)

Tasks:

Add intermediate rewards in step.
Test the reward function with sample games.

Step 6: Implement the RL Agent
We’ll use a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent in agent.py.
Code Example:
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class DQNAgent(nn.Module):
def **init**(self, state_size, action_size):
super(DQNAgent, self).**init**()
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 128)
self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 128)
self.fc3 = nn.Linear(128, action_size)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

    def select_action(self, state, epsilon):
        if random.random() < epsilon:
            return random.randint(0, self.action_size - 1)
        with torch.no_grad():
            q_values = self(state)
            return q_values.argmax().item()

Tasks:

Define state_size and action_size based on your state and action encodings.
Add a replay buffer and training logic.

Step 7: Train the Agent
Create a training script in train.py.
Code Example:
import torch
from judgement_env import JudgementEnv
from agent import DQNAgent

env = JudgementEnv()
state_size = 100 # Adjust based on encoding
action_size = env.round_cards + 1 # Bidding or card play
agent = DQNAgent(state_size, action_size)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(agent.parameters(), lr=0.001)

for episode in range(1000):
state = env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
action = agent.select_action(state, epsilon=0.1)
next_state, reward, done = env.step(0, action) # Player 0 for now # Add to replay buffer and train
state = next_state

Tasks:

Implement a replay buffer and loss calculation.
Start with simple scenarios (e.g., 1 player, fixed cards).

Step 8: Evaluate the Agent
Test the AI’s performance in evaluate.py.
Code Example:
def evaluate(agent, env, num*games=100):
total_score = 0
for * in range(num_games):
state = env.reset()
done = False
while not done:
action = agent.select_action(state, epsilon=0)
state, reward, done = env.step(0, action)
total_score += reward
return total_score / num_games

Tasks:

Compare against a random player.
Test with different player counts.
